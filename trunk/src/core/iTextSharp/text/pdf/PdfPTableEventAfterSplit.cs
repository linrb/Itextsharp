        /**
         * This method is called to indicate that table has been split. It's called after the <CODE>tableLayout</CODE>
         * method and after the table has been drawn on the previous page but before the rest of the table is laid out on
         * the following page.
         * 
         * It is meant to allow modifications of the table, e.g. by changing cells. This is useful for situations when some
         * information has to be repeated, like putting "still <some category>" in the top cell of a column where
         * categorizations for blocks of rows are placed, e.g.
         * 
         * <PRE>
         * 2012  | Jan | 1000 $ | 2000 $ 
         *       | Feb |  900 $ | 2100 $
         * 
         * -------8<----- Page break -------------
         * 
         * still | Mar | 1100 $ | 1900 $ 
         * 2012  | Apr | 1200 $ | 1800 $ 
         *       | May | 1200 $ | 2200 $
         * ...
         * </PRE>
         * 
         * While this might be emulated by just stamping "still 2012" on the page using the currently available event
         * callback <CODE>tableLayout</CODE>, that would fail in the case of the page break happening after the November
         * line, because the text "still 2012" would then overlap with the new entry "2013" in the 2013 January line.
         * 
         * This problem does not exist when modifying the first cell on the new page because that cell will the be laid out
         * to have sufficient height so that no overlaps occur.
         * 
         * Example: 
         * <PRE>
         * public void afterSplitTable(PdfPTable table, PdfPRow startRow, int startIdx) { 
         *     PdfPCell cell = startRow.getCells()[0]; 
         *     cell.addElement(new Paragraph("still " + currentYear)); 
         * }
         * </PRE>
         * 
         * Note that determining the value of <CODE>currentYear</CODE> can be done in <CODE>tableLayout</CODE> 
         * by noting the sizes of the tables laid out there and comparing them with the tracked row indices
         * of the years (via table.getRows()). 
         * 
         * 
         * @param table
         *            the <CODE>PdfPTable</CODE> in use
         * @param startRow
         *            the first <CODE>PdfPRow</CODE> of the table body on the following page
         * @param startIdx
         *            the index of that row
         *
         * @since iText 5.4.3
         */
        void AfterSplitTable(PdfPTable table, PdfPRow startRow, int startIdx);
